# Synthesis
Synthesis.gg

One of my personal projects that gained mild success. The idea of this site was to show all players in the same game at the same time,
and link their accounts to their twitch accounts. If there were several streamers playing against each other at the same time, this
website would display all users streaming from their different perspectives all in one page, giving a unique viewing experience.

Deprecated site due to the changes to the League of Legends API wrapper I used. Could make it work again, but it was largely just too much
effort as getting player information manually.
